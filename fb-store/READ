# Cloud Function Auth Endpoint


#### Firebase cloud function.

- Pass email/password (user pre-config in Firebase/Firestore DB) then 
- Bearer token to access products at at [auth]/products



#### About data 


So while it works fine with React....and localStorage (for persisting state), and this is a free Google service - 50k requests/day.

Fact remains, there's really no way no protect web-api keys nor the email and passwords + tokens (that I'm aware of) in React and if they were to get
stolen, who knows what could happen - I heard stories of some people getting huge bills. So I wouldn't recommend it for a Github project.

I realized this, as I was fixing a branch merging conflict, that I had inadvertently push my .env file.  
Although, I deleted it right away, even getting rid of it from GIT cache/ past-history/commits etc.  It is still not enough, especially when you have
Google Dev tools capable to supply you with a brand new, nicely formatted copy of all your .env vars .gitignore or not. ( source > static > main.js bundle )

Taking the function out of your React application and moving it into the Cloud function, probably the better/safer approach for it.

That was fun.
